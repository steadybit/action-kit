# Steadybit Custom Attacks

This repository represents a work-in-progress documentation and implementation
of Steadybit's custom attack mechanism. If you are curious to learn more,
[reach out to us](https://www.steadybit.com/contact).

## Where to get started

There is currently preciously little documentation around the control flow,
expectations and APIs. If you want to get started, we suggest to start
with the [logging attack](https://github.com/steadybit/custom-attacks/tree/main/examples/nodejs-logging-attack) example.

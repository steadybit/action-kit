# Examples

We offer several examples that you may find helpful to understand and get started with ActionKit:

- [Node.js-based logger](/examples/nodejs-logging): This example implements an action that does nothing besides logging the interaction with the extension
  to stdout. This example is handy for understanding the action API call flow and request/response structures.
- [Go-based kubectl attacks](/examples/go-kubectl): This example implements an actual attack that it triggers via the kubectl CLI. It is an excellent
  example of a low-resource extension, packaging, and runtime.

# Examples

We offer several examples that you may find helpful to understand and get started with ActionKit:

- [Kubernetes Extension](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes): This example implements an action, checks, discovery and UI components that can be used to attack Kubernetes clusters. It is an excellent
  example of all features.
- [Extension-Scaffold](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-scaffold/blob/main/README.md): This is a scaffold for creating new extensions. It contains a lot of examples and explanations.

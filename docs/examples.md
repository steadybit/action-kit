We offer several examples that you may find helpful to understand and get started with ActionKit:

- [Go-based kubectl attacks](/examples/go-kubectl): This example implements an actual attack that it triggers via the kubectl CLI. It is an excellent
  example of a low-resource extension, packaging, and runtime.
- [Kubernetes Extension](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes): This example implements an action, checks, discovery and UI components that can be used to attack Kubernetes clusters. It is an excellent
  example of all features.

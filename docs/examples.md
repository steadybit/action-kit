# Examples

We offer several examples that you may find helpful to understand and get started with AttackKit:

 - [Node.js-based logger](/examples/nodejs-logging-attack): This example implements an attack that does nothing besides logging the interaction with the attack provider to stdout. This example is handy for understanding the attack API call flow and request and response structures.
 - [Go-based kubectl attacks](/examples/go-kubectl-attack): This example implements an actual attack that it triggers via the kubectl CLI. It is an excellent example of a low-resource attack provider, packaging, and runtime.

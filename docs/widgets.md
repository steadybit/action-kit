# Run View Widgets

To enhance the user experience, ActionKit also supports the extension of the experiment run view with widgets. Supported widget types are pre-defined and controlled through the configuration of the ActionDescription and reported metrics.

Supported widgets types:

* [State Over Time](#state-over-time)
* [Log Widget](#log-widget)

## State Over Time

This widget helps visualize how the state of a system or component evolved. For example, to show a Kubernetes pod's readiness state or the state of the monitoring system's alarms. The screenshot below depicts how the [Datadog extension](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-datadog) uses this widget type to visualize the state of [Datadog monitors](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/) over time.

The state over time widget requires two components to function:

- Metrics containing information about the status at any one time.
- Static configuration describes how to filter, aggregate and label the metrics for user presentation.


### Configuration

The widget configuration describes from which metric fields Steadybit should retrieve information. More specifically:

- `identity.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing a unique identifier per desired chart row within the UI.
- `label.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing a human-readable label per desired chart row within the UI.
- `state.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing the current state at any time. Supported values for this field are:
  - `danger`
  - `warn`
  - `info`
  - `success`
- `tooltip.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing the current tooltip at any time.
- `url.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing a URL. When available, it causes a chart segment to turn into a hyperlink.
- `value.hide`: Controls whether the metric values carry meaning and should be shown.

The following snippet is an example depicting the Datadog extension's configuration.

```json
{
  "widgets": [
    {
      "type":  "com.steadybit.widget.state_over_time",
      "title": "Datadog Monitor Status",
      "identity": {
        "from": "datadog.monitor.id"
      },
      "label": {
        "from": "datadog.monitor.name"
      },
      "state": {
        "from": "state"
      },
      "tooltip": {
        "from": "tooltip"
      },
      "url": {
        "from": "url"
      },
      "value": {
        "hide": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Metrics

You can provide data points for this widget through metrics. You can define metrics through various ActionKit endpoints, e.g., the `status` endpoint. The following snippet is an example of a metric generated by the Datadog extension.

```json
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "name": "datadog_monitor_status",
      "metric": {
        "datadog.monitor.id": "123456",
        "datadog.monitor.name": "No deployment replicas",
        "state": "danger",
        "tooltip": "Monitor status is: Alert",
        "url": "https://app.datadoghq.eu/monitors/8520915"
      },
      "timestamp": "2022-11-04T19:16:52+0100",
      "value": 0
    }
  ]
}
```


## Log Widget

This widget helps visualize the output of a log stream. For example, to show the output of a Kubernetes events. The screenshot below depicts how the [Kubernetes extension](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-kubernetes) uses this widget type to visualize the output of a Kubernetes events.
![Kubernetes Events](KubernetesEventsLog.png)



### Configuration

The widget configuration describes from which events fields Steadybit should retrieve information. More specifically:

- LogType that describes the log stream. e.g. "KUBERNETES_EVENTS". Must be the same as the one used in the action messages send (Message.Type).
- Title of the log stream. e.g. "Kubernetes Events"
- Type which is set to "com.steadybit.widget.log" / ComSteadybitWidgetLog constant.


The following snippet is an example depicting the Kubernetes extension's configuration.

```go
return action_kit_api.ActionDescription{
	...
    Widgets: extutil.Ptr([]action_kit_api.Widget{
        action_kit_api.LogWidget{
            Type:    action_kit_api.ComSteadybitWidgetLog,
            Title:   "Kubernetes Events",
            LogType: "KUBERNETES_EVENTS",
            },
        }),
}
```


Each log that is displayed is a representation of a Message. Messages can be send to the platform during status and stop phase of the action. The message must in include the correct type as described above. The message can also include a payload of fields which is displayed in the log widget as tooltip.
e.g.
```go
action_kit_api.Message{
      Message:   "Pulling image 'steadybit/bestseller-fashion'",
      Type:      extutil.Ptr("KUBERNETES_EVENTS"),
      Level:     action_kit_api.Info,
      Timestamp: extutil.Ptr(event.LastTimestamp.Time),
      Fields: extutil.Ptr(action_kit_api.MessageFields{
          "reason":       event.Reason,
          "cluster-name": clusterName,
          "namespace":    event.Namespace,
          "object":       strings.ToLower(event.InvolvedObject.Kind) + "/" + event.InvolvedObject.Name,
      }),
  }
```

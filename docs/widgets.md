# Run View Widgets

To enhance the user experience, ActionKit also supports the extension of the experiment run view with widgets. Supported widget types are pre-defined and controlled through the configuration of the ActionDescription and reported metrics.

Supported widgets types:

* [State Over Time](#state-over-time)

## State Over Time

This widget helps visualize how the state of a system or component evolved. For example, to show a Kubernetes pod's readiness state or the state of the monitoring system's alarms. The screenshot below depicts how the [Datadog extension](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-datadog) uses this widget type to visualize the state of [Datadog monitors](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/) over time.

The state over time widget requires two components to function:

- Metrics containing information about the status at any one time.
- Static configuration describes how to filter, aggregate and label the metrics for user presentation.

### Configuration

The widget configuration describes from which metric fields Steadybit should retrieve information. More specifically:

- `identity.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing a unique identifier per desired chart row within the UI.
- `label.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing a human-readable label per desired chart row within the UI.
- `state.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing the current state at any time. Supported values for this field are:
  - `danger`
  - `warn`
  - `info`
  - `success`
- `tooltip.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing the current tooltip at any time.
- `url.from`: Maps to the name of a metric field containing a URL. When available, it causes a chart segment to turn into a hyperlink.
- `value.hide`: Controls whether the metric values carry meaning and should be shown.

The following snippet is an example depicting the Datadog extension's configuration.

```json
{
  "widgets": [
    {
      "type":  "com.steadybit.widget.state_over_time",
      "title": "Datadog Monitor Status",
      "identity": {
        "from": "datadog.monitor.id"
      },
      "label": {
        "from": "datadog.monitor.name"
      },
      "state": {
        "from": "state"
      },
      "tooltip": {
        "from": "tooltip"
      },
      "url": {
        "from": "url"
      },
      "value": {
        "hide": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Metrics

You can provide data points for this widget through metrics. You can define metrics through various ActionKit endpoints, e.g., the `status` endpoint. The following snippet is an example of a metric generated by the Datadog extension.

```json
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "name": "datadog_monitor_status",
      "metric": {
        "datadog.monitor.id": "123456",
        "datadog.monitor.name": "No deployment replicas",
        "state": "danger",
        "tooltip": "Monitor status is: Alert",
        "url": "https://app.datadoghq.eu/monitors/8520915"
      },
      "timestamp": "2022-11-04T19:16:52+0100",
      "value": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

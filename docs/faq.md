## I registered my attack provider, but I cannot see the attack within the experiment editor?

There are two common issues causing this:

 1. The agent couldn't (properly) communicate with the attack provider. To analyze this further, please inspect the agent log.
 2. Your team within Steadybit is not allowed to use the attacks by the attack provider. Inspect the team configuration via the Steadybit settings views to ensure that the attacks are allowed for your team.

## I registered my action provider, but I cannot see the action within the experiment editor?

There are two common issues causing this:

1. The agent couldn't (properly) communicate with the extension. To analyze this further, please inspect the agent log.
2. Your team within Steadybit is not allowed to use the actions. Inspect the team configuration via the Steadybit settings views to
   ensure that the actions are allowed for your team.

    Label: "Any",
    Value: "*",
  },
  action_kit_api.ParameterOptionsFromTargetAttribute{
    Attribute: "k8s.namespace",
  },
}),

### Differences to the deprecated AttackKit API v0.5.0

- **Breaking:** This version contains breaking changes in the ActionKit API.
    - Various APIs were renamed from `*Attack*` to `*Action*`
    - Attack description `category` is now optional and no longer an enumeration.
    - Attack's `targetType` is now optional.
    - `target` is now optional within prepare request bodies.
    - new required configuration value `kind` in preparation for action, checks load test support.
    - Several types were renamed to make it easier to under when to use them.
    - `action_kit_api.Ptr` was removed from this module to avoid requirement for Go `>1.18`.
    - Enum names for HTTP methods were changed to avoid context specific prefixes.
    - Aligned all enum values to lower case (but upper case is accepted as well).
- Added the ability to upload artifacts to Steadybit as part of the `prepare`,
  `start`, `status` and `stop` endpoints.
- Added `warn` level for `Message`.
